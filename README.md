# Bell States

A 2-qubit Bell state, also known as an EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) pair, is one of the four specific maximally entangled quantum states of two qubits. These states are named after John Bell, who formulated Bell's theorem to test the principles of quantum mechanics.

## Definition

The four Bell states are:

```latex
|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle + |11\rangle)
|\Phi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|00\rangle - |11\rangle)
|\Psi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|01\rangle + |10\rangle)
|\Psi^-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (|01\rangle - |10\rangle)


These states are used extensively in quantum information theory and quantum computing because of their entanglement properties.
